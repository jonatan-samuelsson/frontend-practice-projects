## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ARIA
- Vanilla JS


### What I learned

Thogh it wasn't part of the challenge as such, since the challenge appeared in the accessibilty learning path, I decided to read up a little on accessibility and to implement some of what I found. This led me to pay some attention to both the cloe-button on the thank you section, which got an ARIA-label to let screen readers know what it's for, and the rating radio buttons, for which I ended up slightly adjusting my design solution to accomodate a better focus-state highlight.

### Continued development
I am keen to learn more accessibility techniques now, as I feel I am starting to see some of the little tweaks that go very far. Also, on a side note, I realized I need to brush up on my formData management skills in JS.
