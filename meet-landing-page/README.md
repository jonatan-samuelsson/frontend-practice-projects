## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements





## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Getting more confident translating sizes and positioning from figma files into responsive units like vw/rem while still getting the designed screen sizes to look as intended. 

I had fun with this one, particularly the altering images of the hero and footer sections, which taught me a lot about background-image positioning and creating responsive paddings that correspond to the backgrounds to position the content in relation to images. 

Also the section-nubering elements were a lot of fun. Initially I experimented with background images, but ultimately settled on a round elemt border combined with a pseudoelement and a padding-top to accomodate it.
