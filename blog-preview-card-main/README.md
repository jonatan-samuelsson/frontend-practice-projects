## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Combining clamp width and object-fit made the image cropping work

### Continued development

Still haven't figured out a consistent way of dealing with padding and margins. I try to use only, say top or bottom margins throughout, but then I run into adding both, or just padding anyway.

### Useful resources

- [Object-fit property](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-cropping-images-object-fit) - This helped me get the image to crop correctly when resizing
