### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size





## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Somnetimes, fixed sizes are actually the way to go. I ususally avoid them, but with these clearly defined cards and the three different screen sizes specified in the fig-file, fixing their widths was actually the easy way to go. I did give the widths in rem units though, so that if someone has different font size set on their browser, card sizes do adapt to font sizes.

### Continued development

It seems random to me if grid-template-areas work or not. I don't know exactly what I did right to make it work as intended, but all of a sudden it did.
